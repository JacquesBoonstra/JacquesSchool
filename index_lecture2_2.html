		<h1>Jacques Boonstra</h1>
		<h2>Inholland Student</h2>
		<p>I'm Jacques, I'm a student of Haarlem Inholland. I don't live in Haarlem, I live in Amstelveen and have to travel an hour, by use of public transport, to go to my school. </p>
		
		<p>I've gone to a lot of places and countries. </p>
		<p>Recently I've gone to London where I purchased a nice fridge magnet as a souvenir for 20 &pound;.</p>
		<p>I've also visited New York where I bought a baseball glove for 35 &dollar;. </p>
		<p>After my trip to New York I decided on going to Paris and getting a nice miniature Eifell Tower figure for 10 &euro;.</p>
